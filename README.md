# weather-app

this is a small app that I created for a friend to scrape weather data from NOAA.

MVC design pattern
It scrapes specific pages from NOAA, cleans the data and puts it into a database.
Then it graphs that data on the main screen.

The graph.js library that is responsible for displaying data to the screen is all made from scratch.

Note: the .htaccess files are not included
